Facial Expression Recognition Using CNN and VGG16
Project Overview
This project focuses on facial expression recognition using deep learning. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the VGG16 model, was fine-tuned for classifying emotions from facial images. The model was trained on a dataset with seven emotion categories, and the project involves data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Face Expression Recognition Dataset, which contains 35,000 annotated images across seven emotion categories: happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets:

Training Set: 24,500 images
Validation Set: 5,000 images
Test Set: 5,500 images
Project Features
Transfer Learning with VGG16: The VGG16 pre-trained model was used and fine-tuned for emotion classification.
Data Augmentation: Applied techniques to improve the robustness of the model.
Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix was used to analyze model performance across different emotion categories.
Hyperparameter Tuning: The model was tuned using various learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters via Keras Tuner.
Tools and Technologies
Python: For implementing the project.
Keras/TensorFlow: For deep learning and CNN model development.
Keras Tuner: For hyperparameter optimization.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualization, including confusion matrix and image predictions.
Sklearn: For evaluation metrics.

Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on the VGG16 pre-trained network, fine-tuned with additional layers to adapt to emotion classification. The architecture consists of:

Input Layer: Image size of 48x48 pixels.
Convolutional Layers: 16 layers from VGG16 with ReLU activations.
Fully Connected Layers: Custom layers for classification into 7 emotion categories.

Results and Evaluation
Accuracy: The model achieved 85% accuracy on the validation set and 83% on the test set.
Confusion Matrix: The model performs well in classifying emotions like happiness and sadness but struggles with fear and surprise.

Future Improvements
Increase dataset size or apply synthetic data generation to enhance model generalization.
Explore other architectures like ResNet or Inception.
Apply ensemble learning techniques.
Perform additional fine-tuning of VGG16 layers to improveÂ performance.
